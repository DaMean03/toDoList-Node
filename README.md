Like every rookie I started with making a to-Do List app.
It's simple with only interactions being posting and deleting your tasks.

Stack:
Node
Express.js
EJS



To run on your computer:
1. You need [mongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/products/tools/shell) and [node](https://nodejs.org/en) running on your computer before starting.
2. Download the files or run "git clone https://github.com/DaMean03/toDoList-Node.git" in terminal.
3. Download the dependencies by running "npm i" in terminal.
4. Then you can start the server with "node index.js".
5. Server runs on port 3000 so to access the app type "localhost:3000" in your web browser.
